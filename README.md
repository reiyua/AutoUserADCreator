# AutoUserADCreator

Simple Microsoft PowerShell script I had to make as part of my General Diploma in I.T at TAFE NSW that batch creates users within existing OU's as part of an Active Directory Domain Forest.

My job was to modify this code to include simple checks to prevent issues such as duplicate users.

An example CSV file has been provided for reference.
